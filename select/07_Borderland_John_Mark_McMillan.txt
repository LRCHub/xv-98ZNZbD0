Living in the borderland
I don't feel like a boy, I don't feel like a man
In the things I don't understand
Things like love, like the law
Like the law of the jungle
Are we all animals
Are we all animals sharpening
Our teeth and claws
Stocking up on cannonballs
Living like nobody knows
They can't hold on to love
And live by the law, the law of the jungle
Help me Holy Jesus
Won't you show me how to live
I've got monsters at my table
I've got Bibles bent like shivs
Help me Holy Lord
I see the light of heaven's porch
But so many of us are born here
Outside your chain link fence
Living in the borderland
You gotta fend for yourself,
Let the dogs eat the other man
Living in the borderland
You gotta take what you get,
Gotta get what you can
Are we all dangerous
Are we all dangerous lost boys shoring up
Pockets full of fairy dust
Suffering the wanderlust
They all get crushed without love
By the law, the law of the jungle
Living in the borderland
Are you going to fight like a boy,
Gonna run like a man
Living in the borderland
Gotta take what you get,
Gotta get what you can
But you can't hold on
Can't hold on to love
You can't hold on
You can't hold on and live
By the law
