Hooray to every miracle
Hooray to every ball
All that he wants
Is to be part of the winners
Who capture their moments of luck
In bending for hours on the river
On the river
Far out in winter wonderland
Greet every day with a smile
Oh I don't need
The rage of a sinner
With a mind of his own
And the grace of the winner
Who captures his moments of luck
There is winter everyday
Inside the heart of the maniac
And rivers frozen over
Ice is growing
For at least this merry winter
In the hearts
Of those related to the brace
For every river bears his autograph
He rides them all
At least this merry winter
Keeps him going
Tranquilizes on a journey back
It really turns him on
Yeah, it really turns him on
It really turns him on
Oh I don't need
The rage of a sinner
With a mind of his own
And the grace of the winner
Who captures his moments of luck
In bending for hours on the river
On the river, on the river
Yeah yeah yeah on the river
On the river
