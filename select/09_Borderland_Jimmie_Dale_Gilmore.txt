Well, I headed back to the borderland
When the home-guard went insane
No use trying to work with people
Who can't tell fire from rain

The judge had tried to hitch a ride
But I only took him half way
Friends are friends but in the borderland
You can't be careful of what you say

The sheriff sent me every warning he could
But I knew more than he
My home is both sides of the borderland
So he knows where I'll be

The businessman in a sleek sedan
Thought he could beat me here
But roads fade out before you reach the line
And the signposts disappear

So good to be home in the borderland
Where things are not what they seem
So good to be home in the borderland
Between the dawn and the dream

The brown-eyed girl from the battleground
Had just met me half-way
The border-guard had let her pass
But said you could not stay

She gazed upon the mountain above
And she reached out her hand
The she let go with all her might
And loved the borderland

So good to be home in the borderland
Where things are not what they seem
So good to be home in the borderland
Between the dawn and the dream
