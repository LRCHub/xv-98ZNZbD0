I've got you on my mind
Soaring through silent skies
Over the coastal city
Across the ocean
And I'm carried on a breeze
Up north is where I'm going
On the borderland of sleep
Where you're living
I want to be with you
I know you through and through
Dreams form and days go by
My companion
And I'm carried on a breeze
Up north is where I'm going
On the borderland of sleep
Where you're living
I fall asleep, get numb in my feet
And hear something in my soul
You're telling stories, sing me a verse in
Languages no one knows
Halfway I wake up
Thwarted by bad luck
Wind's blowing from the west
Slowly the night moves
I'm feeling mournful
My love is gone away
But I know where I am bound
In time I'll be returning
Back when all the lights go out
And I'm dreaming
I'll be carried on a breeze
Up north is where I'm going
On the borderland of sleep
Where you're living
