Watch the stars go black
Imminent attack
Catalyst of fear
Hold your children near
Bombs rain from the sky
Kiss your dreams goodbye
Borderland at war
The horror rages on
No price is too high, he's paying with your life
This war can't be won, perpetual strife
The shame of an empire, written in blood
Never forget - Slava Ukraini
Gone in a hailstorm of shrapnel and fire
Decades of concord in seconds undone
Face again a world reshaped by lords of war
Fuel for the machine
Our Achille's heel
Burning fields of grain
Blood of children, maimed
Hellfire unleashed
Bleak all prospects for peace
At the break of dawn
The sirens blare once more
No price is too high, he's paying with your life
This war can't be won, perpetual strife
The shame of an empire, written in blood
Never forget - Slava Ukraini
Catalyst of fear
Hold your children near
Kiss your dreams goodbye
Bombs rain from the sky
Gone in a hailstorm of shrapnel and fire
Decades of concord in seconds undone
Face again a world reshaped by lords of war
